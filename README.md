# Skyline Orbit (SkO) ‚Äì Orbital Tow & Service (OTS)

**Skyline Orbit (SkO)** is a modular system in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) designed to tow, refuel, and repair commercial and government satellites. The project addresses critical sustainability and cost challenges in LEO: satellites that fail due to minor issues generate orbital debris and require expensive replacements. SkO extends satellite lifespans, reduces orbital debris, and actively minimizes orbital waste, creating a scalable orbital service model. The solution combines advanced robotics, AI for autonomous navigation, and repair modules, offering an innovative and responsible approach to the LEO economy.

## üõ∞Ô∏è Project Overview

Skyline Orbit (SkO) is a modular orbital vehicle designed to provide basic maintenance services and towing to satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). By extending satellite lifespans, preventing premature failures, and reducing orbital debris, SkO creates a new sustainable and scalable service model for the LEO economy. The system operates autonomously or semi-autonomously, supporting multiple satellite types and constellations.

**Mission:**  
Enable sustainable, long-term use of LEO through modular in-orbit servicing that includes maintenance, repairs, 3D printing, and component reuse.
